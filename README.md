# install guide

This module is written in Python 3 and needs Python 3.5 or higher. The reason for this is that most of the asynchronous processes use the embedded asyncio core library.

Pip is used for package management. You can install all dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure pip here is for Python 3. If you're not sure, you can try running:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
